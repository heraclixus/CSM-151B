    "Example for __spilling__: In most register allocators, each variable is assigned to either a CPU register or to main memory. The advantage of using a register is speed. Computers have a limited number of registers, so not all variables can be assigned to registers. A __\"spilled variable\"__ is a variable in main memory rather than in a CPU register. The operation of moving a variable from a register to memory is called spilling, while the reverse operation of moving a variable from memory to a register is called __filling__. In high-level programming languages, it is possible that variable A is mot used often but B is, so after a modification of variable A (suppose it is stored in register r2), it will be saved into memory, and variable B(from memory) will be loaded into register r2.<br>\n",
